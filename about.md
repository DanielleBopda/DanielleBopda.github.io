# About Me

Hello! I'm **Danielle C. Bopda**—a Data Scientist and Business Analytics professional who transitioned from a healthcare background into the world of data. I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Data Science with a certificate in Business Analytics from UMGC (December 2024).

My passion lies in building **impact‑driven, practical solutions** that bridge technology and opportunity across industries and continents. As an African‑American woman, I aspire to **connect the U.S. and African tech ecosystems**, empowering communities with data‑driven insights and equitable access.

Beyond analytics, I’m dedicated to helping previous generations adopt technology safely and confidently. I’m a mother, an early riser who enjoys painting, drawing, and reflective walks, and I believe strongly in compassion and faith.

## Aspirations

- **Cybersecurity & Bridges:** Become a cybersecurity engineer/analyst and a bridge between the USA and Africa.
- **Entrepreneurship:** Launch a company that solves real problems with high ROI and social impact.
- **Storytelling & Education:** Share my journey and insights through media platforms to educate and inspire others.
- **Career Growth:** Secure a data‑driven role that allows me to apply my skills and continue learning.

Thanks for visiting my portfolio—let’s connect and make an impact together!
