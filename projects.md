# Projects

Each project below illustrates how I tackle real‑world problems end‑to‑end from data preparation and modeling to interpretation and business recommendations. I prioritize transparency, fairness, and operational value.


## 🛡️ AI‑Driven Intrusion Detection System | Cybersecurity

**Problem:** Security Operations Centers face millions of network flows daily and need to identify diverse cyberattacks quickly without overwhelming analysts.  
**Approach:** Used the CICIDS2017 dataset (2.8M+ flows) to train decision trees, neural networks, and other models to classify attacks such as DoS, PortScan, Brute Force, web attacks, infiltration, and botnet activity. Structured analysis for both technical and non‑technical audiences, connecting modeling choices to risk and operational value.  
**Impact:** Produced an end‑to‑end ML workflow that supports SOC teams by automatically flagging high‑risk traffic and reducing alert fatigue. Provides actionable insights for enterprise security.  
**Tech:** Python, Pandas, Scikit‑learn, Decision Trees, Neural Networks, Data Visualization.

## 🗓️ Intelligent Appointment Scheduling Assistant | Healthcare

**Problem:** Clinics waste time on manual appointment scheduling, leading to inefficiencies, errors, and limited patient access.  
**Approach:** Built a conversational AI system using Amazon Lex to understand patient intents and slots, AWS Lambda for backend validation, Cognito for secure access, and S3 for hosting. Designed dialogues, slot collection, and validation logic to generate structured, validated appointment records.  
**Impact:** Reduces call‑center burden, increases data accuracy, and offers 24/7 digital access, improving staff productivity and patient satisfaction.  
**Tech:** AWS Lex, Lambda, Cognito, S3, Python/Node.

## ⚖️ Fairness‑Optimized Credit Decisioning | Fintech & Responsible AI

**Problem:** Traditional credit models maximize accuracy but can encode bias, excluding creditworthy customers and increasing regulatory risk.  
**Approach:** Evaluated logistic regression, neural networks and random forests on original and fairness‑optimized datasets. Measured both performance and fairness metrics, implementing threshold optimization and bias mitigation techniques to align with regulatory standards.  
**Impact:** Demonstrated that fairness‑aware preprocessing can improve economic outcomes and reduce bias without sacrificing profitability, providing an auditable, deployable framework for responsible lending.  
**Tech:** Python, Pandas, Scikit‑learn, Fairness evaluation, Explainability (e.g., SHAP), Financial analysis.

## 📉 Customer Retention Analytics System | Telecom & Fintech

**Problem:** Recurring revenue businesses suffer when churn is detected only after customers leave. Identifying at‑risk customers early is critical for preventing revenue loss.  
**Approach:** Combined customer usage, billing, and service interaction data to predict churn using explainable models. Performed EDA, correlation analysis, KNN classification, and model optimization while connecting results to financial relevance and operational usability.  
**Impact:** Transforms churn from a retrospective metric into a predictive signal, enabling targeted retention strategies that reduce acquisition costs and protect customer lifetime value.  
**Tech:** Python, Pandas, Scikit‑learn, KNN, EDA, Visualization, Business analytics.

## 🩺 Diabetes Forecasting | Healthcare Analytics

**Problem:** Diabetes affects hundreds of millions worldwide. Early prediction enables timely intervention and better outcomes.  
**Approach:** Applied SVM classifiers to the Pima Indians Diabetes Database. Conducted data cleaning, EDA, feature scaling, and hyperparameter tuning.  
**Impact:** Demonstrated feasibility of SVM models for clinical decision support, helping healthcare providers prioritize screenings and manage resources effectively.  
**Tech:** Python, Pandas, Scikit‑learn, Support Vector Machines (SVM), EDA.

## 👥 Pharma Employee Attrition Insights | HR Analytics

**Problem:** High employee attrition disrupts pharmaceutical research, production, and sales performance.  
**Approach:** Built interactive dashboards (Power BI) to explore drivers of attrition (e.g., workload, satisfaction, compensation) and identify at‑risk groups.  
**Impact:** Supports HR decision‑makers with clear metrics and recommendations to improve retention and reduce turnover costs.  
**Tech:** Power BI (DAX), Python (EDA), Visualization.
